## Why use NoJar?
If you have a dedicated server at home and you want to quickly set up a Minecraft server, this is the tool to use.
<br><br>
## How does it work?
We have not invented a new technology. It is still running on Java. Within the main folder there are Java files and all their dll's. Instead of downloading Java, we have just embedded the post-installation files into the NoJar server.
<br><br>
## Limitations
- Only Playable version is Minecraft 1.13.2
- Download File size is quite large. (We are working on this currently to make the file size smaller by hosting some of the files on a server and then it fetches the files from the server, whilst keeping the first run relatively fast).
## Pros
- No setup required (All files are already included and thus is plug and play).
- Very fast
- As it is still running on a normal Java, just embedded, you can still have plugins and everything you want to have.
### Note: the server.rar file already has a world with a seed in it, meaning that every server you make will have the same world. This is for the sake of time
of server boot. If you want a random seed, delete the world folder. It may take a few more seconds to boot the server though.
